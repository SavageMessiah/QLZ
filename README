It's a Zdoom launcher!

Supports:
(G)zdoom
chocolate doom
prboom+

zandronum (for most things)
probably others


Includes autohotkey source - Launcher.ahk
Only Launcher.exe is needed to run.

Here's a Brief Guide To Doing Doom Stuff:

One Time Setup:
1. Download QLZ from https://bitbucket.org/SavageMessiah/qlz/downloads/Launcher.exe. Stick the exe in your gzdoom directory.
2. Copy your doom.wad, doom2.wad, etc from wherever they are now into the gzdoom directory.
3. Run launcher.exe
4. Select gzdoom.exe for the gzdoom location (it's not obvious at all but it also supports chocolate doom and prboom+)
5. Select your gzdoom directory as the IWAD directory

To Play Something:
1. Select the IWAD you want from the list
2. Click and drag the wads you want into additional files
2a. Use up and down to rearrange the files if needed - I think Beautiful Doom may need this but I don't remember the correct order.
3. Click Launch

It will remember all those settings between runs. If you want to switch between different things you play a lot, type a name in for the profile (at the bottom) and click save. Then you can switch profiles by selecting one and clicking load.

It supports most useful doom filetypes - wad, pk3, deh, replays (in prboom+), and savegames.

I rather like adding my gzdoom savegame to my profile for a megawad that I'm playing (I usually only play 1 or 2 levels at a time). Then I can just hit launch and get dropped right back into the action.
